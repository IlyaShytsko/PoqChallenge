# Poq iOS Technical Challenge

## Summary

I aimed to create a clean, maintainable, and scalable approach to handling network operations by incorporating several significant features: reusability, asynchronous support, error handling, custom configuration for requests, and decoding strategies.

For data representation, I used modern techniques using UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource and UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout. This approach facilitates faster UI development and enhances the reliability of the collection display.

To speed up the completion of the task, I used the third-party networking library Alamofire.

The MVC architecture was used as the most suitable for quickly creating a lightweight application without unnecessary code complexity.
